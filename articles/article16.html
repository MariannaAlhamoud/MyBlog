            <h1>All about education</h1>
            <p>Education, discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or school-like
                environments as opposed to various nonformal and informal means of socialization (e.g., rural
                development projects and education through parent-child relationships).</p>
            <p>Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society. In
                this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation.
                Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle
                classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a
                culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role
                in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one
                would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and all activities
                are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers. As societies grow
                more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one generation to the next becomes
                more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must evolve more selective and efficient means of
                cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the school and the specialist called the teacher.
            </p>
            <p>As society becomes ever more complex and schools become ever more institutionalized, educational
                experience becomes less directly related to daily life, less a matter of showing and learning in the
                context of the workaday world, and more abstracted from practice, more a matter of distilling, telling,
                and learning things out of context. This concentration of learning in a formal atmosphere allows
                children to learn far more of their culture than they are able to do by merely observing and imitating.
                As society gradually attaches more and more importance to education, it also tries to formulate the
                overall objectives, content, organization, and strategies of education. Literature becomes laden with
                advice on the rearing of the younger generation. In short, there develop philosophies and theories of
                education.</p>
