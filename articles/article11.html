            <h1>All about Javascript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside
                HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.</p>
            <p>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also
                utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is
                Node.js.
                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
                multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
                data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
                I/O.
                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
            </p>
            <h2>History about Javascript</h2>
           <p> During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
            behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development
            scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator.
            They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language,
            while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.</p>
