            <h1>All about square numbers</h1>
            <p>The expression for the nth square number is n2. This is also equal to the sum of the first n odd numbers
                as can be seen in the above pictures, where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd
                number of points (shown in magenta). </p>
            <p>In base 10, a square number can end only with digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, as follows:
                if the last digit of a number is 0, its square ends in 00;
                if the last digit of a number is 1 or 9, its square ends in an even digit followed by a 1;
                if the last digit of a number is 2 or 8, its square ends in an even digit followed by a 4;
                if the last digit of a number is 3 or 7, its square ends in an even digit followed by a 9;
                if the last digit of a number is 4 or 6, its square ends in an odd digit followed by a 6; and
                if the last digit of a number is 5, its square ends in 25.
                In base 12, a square number can end only with square digits (like in base 12, a prime number can end
                only with prime digits or 1), that is, 0, 1, 4 or 9, as follows:
                if a number is divisible both by 2 and by 3 (that is, divisible by 6), its square ends in 0, and its
                preceding digit must be 0 or 3;
                if a number is divisible neither by 2 nor by 3, its square ends in 1, and its preceding digit must be
                even;
                if a number is divisible by 2, but not by 3, its square ends in 4, and its preceding digit must be 0, 1,
                4, 5, 8, or 9; and
                if a number is not divisible by 2, but by 3, its square ends in 9, and its preceding digit must be 0 or
                6.</p>
            <p>A square number, sometimes also called a perfect square, is the result of an integer multiplied by
                itself. 1, 4, 9, 16 and 25 are the first five square numbers. In a formula, the square of a number n is
                denoted n2 (exponentiation), usually pronounced as "n squared". The name square number comes from the
                name of the shape; see below.</p>
