                <h1>All about fruits, vegetables and mold</h1>
                <p>Eating fruit provides health benefits. People who eat more fruits and vegetables as part of an
                    overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases, such as heart
                    disease, including heart attack and stroke and certain types of cancers. Eating foods such as fruits
                    that are lower in calories instead of higher-calorie food may be useful in helping to lower calorie
                    intake. Fruits provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body, such as fiber,
                    vitamin C, potassium, and folate. For a list of the health benefits associated with fruit, visit the
                    Fruits Group page.
                </p>
                <p>Eating vegetables provides health benefits. People who eat more vegetables and fruits as part of an
                    overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases, such as heart
                    disease, including heart attack and stroke and certain types of cancers. Eating foods such as
                    vegetables that are lower in calories instead of higher-calorie food may be useful in helping to
                    lower calorie intake. Vegetables provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body,
                    such as vitamins A and C, fiber, folate, and potassium. For a list of the health benefits associated
                    with vegetables, see Nutrients and Health Benefits on the Vegetable page. </p>
                <p>Some molds are used to make certain kinds of cheeses including (Roquefort, blue, Gorgonzola, Stilton,
                    Camembert, and Brie). The mold on these cheeses is safe to eat. Mold on other types of cheeses
                    should not be there. Discard any soft cheese showing mold. For hard cheese, such as Cheddar, cut off
                    at least 1-inch around and below the mold spot (keep the knife out of the mold itself). After
                    trimming off the mold, the remaining cheese should be safe to eat. Re-cover the cheese in fresh wrap
                    and keep refrigerated. Exceptions: Some salamis,San Francisco, Italian and Eastern European types,
                    have a characteristic thin, white mold coating; they shouldn't show any other mold. Dry cured
                    country hams have surface mold that must be scrubbed off before cooking. Discard any soft fruits or
                    vegetables, jams and jellies, bread, and baked goods that have mold.</p>
