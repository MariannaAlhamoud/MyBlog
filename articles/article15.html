            <h1>All about cube numbers</h1>
            <p>A cube number is the product of three identical factors (e.g. 2 x 2 x 2 = 8). So, a cube number is any
                number which has been multiplied by itself, twice.
                Sometimes, the language 'cubed' is used (e.g. '2 cubed' = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8).Factor = a whole number that
                divides into another whole number, with no remainder.

                Product = the result when two or more numbers are multiplied together.

                Cube number = a number multiplied by itself twice.

                Cube root = the factor which can be multiplied by itself twice to produce the cube number.</p>
            <p>Children are first introduced to cube numbers in Year 5. Here, children are expected to recognise cube
                numbers and to know the notation for cubed ('3'). Children should also recognise the application of
                cubed numbers in units used to measure volume (mm3, cm3, km3).

                In Year 6, children consolidate their understanding and are expected to solve problems using different
                cubic units, such as: mm3, cm3, m3 and km3.

                Before introducing cube numbers, ensure that children have a solid understanding of multiplication and
                division and that they are familiar with square numbers (the product of a number multiplied by itself).
                Make sure that children know the vocabulary: factor, product, square, cube and inverse as this will make
                it much easier for them to understand teaching input related to cube numbers. Use manipulatives to start

                Use our complete Squares, Cubes and Factors lesson pack to teach your class how to identify and use
                squared and cubed numbers, as well as how to find factor pairs. Revisit the children’s understanding in
                the context of area and volume with our Primes, Squares and Cubes series of lessons.

                Investigations involving cube numbers
                Children develop more secure understanding when they have the oppotunity to find out the answers for
                themselves. So, when you come to teach cube numbers to your class, why not try one of these
                investigations:

                1. "What do the following numbers have in common: 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000?

                2. "The cube of an odd number is always odd and the cube nu,ber of an even nuber is always even." Is
                this statement always, sometimes, or never true? Prove it!

                3. The first ten cube numbers are: 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000. What are the next ten cube
                numbers?
