            <h1>All about speech</h1>
            <p>Have you ever been wondering what part of speech the articles belong to?
                Do you think they are pronouns, adverbs or adjectives?
                Well, this article will help you with all that you need to know.
                Learn what articles are, their definition, types, how to use them,
                and uses, along with examples. Also, try out the practice questions
                given to check how far you have understood the same.</p>
            <h2>What is the definition of an Article?</h2>
            <p>An article, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is defined as
                “any of a small set of words or affixes (such as a, an, and the)
                used with nouns to limit or give definiteness to the application.”
                According to the Collins Dictionary, “an article is a kind of determiner.
                In English, ‘a’ and ‘an’ are called the indefinite article,
                and ‘the’ is called the definite article.”
                The Macmillan Dictionary defines an article as “a type of determiner
                (word used before a noun) that shows whether you are referring to a
                particular thing or to a general example of something. The indefinite
                article is ‘a’ or ‘an’ and the definite article is ‘the’."</p>
            <h2>'A' or 'An'?</h2>
            <p>The article ‘an’ is normally used before words that begin with vowel
                sounds. However, this is often confused with the idea that it can be
                used before words that start with a vowel. Look at the examples given
                below to understand how this works.</p>
            <p>Children’s speech is often unclear when they first start to talk, but most children will get clearer in
                time. Some children, though, have particular challenges making or using speech sounds and will need
                extra help from a speech and language therapist to talk clearly. We often do not know why a child has
                challenges using speech sounds, but it can be linked to:

                .Challenges with other areas of their communication skills, for example talking and understanding words
                .   Cleft palate
                .Having other family members that need help with speech sounds
            </p>
